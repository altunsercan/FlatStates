# FlatStates
Unity3d implementation for keeping states as predicates

## What is this?
As a preliminary test for my AI projects, I decided to create a C# implementation of Unification algorithm. It does not comply with all requirements that exists in languages like Prolog but currently works in my use cases.

I don't recommend using this in a project at its current state. But feel free to take a look and judge.
